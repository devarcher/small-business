      address: "1101 W Lynn St, Austin, TX 78703",
      hours: "6:30am - 8pm",
      description: "One of the pioneers of Austin’s specialty coffee scene, Caffe Medici began in 2006 in a bungalow off West Lynn and has since expanded to four locations. Each has their own charm, but the original feels most lived-in, keeping the breezy but sophisticated atmosphere of the Clarksville neighborhood alive with Clever pourovers from Wisconsin's Ruby Roasters and espresso from Cuvee, Austin's flagship third wave roaster."

      address: "4200 N Lamar Blvd #120, Austin, TX 78756",
      hours: "6:30am - 7pm",
      description: "This is a great coffee shop to hang out at, work on your laptop, and sip delicious high quality coffee grown on the slopes of volcanoes half a world away. Yet somehow this place never feels pretentious even as you spend $7 on a latte. Part of the reason for that is that the people who come here are down-to-earth Austin folks. And the people who work here are the same way."

      name: "Figure 8 Coffee",
      address: "1111 Chicon St, Austin, TX 78702",
      hours: "7am - 7pm",
      description: "Helmed by an alum of iconic local band Voxtrot and his long-time girlfriend (an accomplished musician herself), Figure 8 counts a cast of stalwart musicians and artists as regulars, attracted by some of the best coffee in town. The white powder-coated espresso machine rotates between beans from Portland’s Coava, SF’s Four Barrel, and locals Wild Gift and Tweed, and every shot of espresso is served with a chaser of Topo Chico. Pull up a seat at their community table (built out of an old conveyor belt) and after a few minutes of eavesdropping you'll probably have a new favorite band."

      address: "2159 S Lamar Blvd, Austin, TX 78704",
      hours: "7am - 6pm",
      description: "A skylight over the seating area gives Patika a sunny, peaceful energy that drives its reputation as one of the calmest shops in town. The roasters change regularly, but count on their V60 pourovers to be some of the tastiest in the city, especially when paired with next-level baked goods like their peanut butter sriracha cookies. On Wednesday and Thursdays it doubles as a low-key concert venue, hosting highly palatable jazz and softer indie rock."

      name: "Merit Coffee",
      address: "222 West Ave #120, Austin, TX 78701",
      hours: "7am - 8pm",
      description: "This Merit Coffee location in the Seaholm district is a great place to meet up with people or get some work done downtown (there’s a ton of outlets and good wifi). It’s also very dog-friendly, with people just letting their dogs up on the banquets. The coffee’s good – they roast their own beans – and there’s some outdoor seating, Tacodeli tacos, and and pastries like doughnuts and kolaches from Bakery Lorraine in San Antonio. This location is on the smaller side, and at peak hours it can get loud and busy, to the degree that there’s sometimes nowhere to sit. But conveniently, it’s near the new library and Trader Joe’s, so you can return those overdue books and do some grocery shopping before or after you get your caffeine fix."
